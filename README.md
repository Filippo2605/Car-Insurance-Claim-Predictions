1 Scenario of Interest
Imagine you are working for a car insurance company that has shared its annual car insurance data.
As a data scientist, your task is to analyze the dataset and build a predictive model to understand
customer behaviors. The ultimate goal is to predict whether a customer is likely to claim their car
insurance (1) or not (0). This insight can help the company make informed risk assessment and
customer engagement decisions.

2 Goal #1: Data Exploration and Feature Engineering
Download the Car Insurance Dataset from the following link and load it into a pandas DataFrame.
2.1 Data Exploration
Perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the dataset. Generate summary statistics,
visualizations, and any relevant plots to understand the distribution of features. Identify potential
relationships between features and the target variable.
2.2 Feature Engineering
If needed, handle missing values and outliers appropriately. Transform categorical variables using
techniques we saw during the lab sessions (e.g., one-hot encoding).

3 Goal #2: Build your classification model!
First of all, split your dataset into training and testing sets.
3.1 Train
Then, choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random
forest, etc.) and train it on your data.

3.2 Model Evaluation
Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall,
F1-score). Discuss the results and any insights gained from the evaluation.
3.3 Fine-tuning
As seen in the last laboratory session, experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the modelâ€™s
performance. Make a comparison with respect to the previous results.

4 Goal #3: Summarize your findings
Reflect on the challenges faced during all the steps and propose any potential improvements or additional steps that could be taken
